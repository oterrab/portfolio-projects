# 🗺 Portfolio Guide

Hello 👋, is there anybody in there?

This is my Portfolio Summary where I provide a walkthrough to all of my forays into data analytics projects and courses. I'll track my projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

Feel free to chat with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaspassosbarreto/) about my projects!

# Python

**Level:**

**Skills:** Data cleaning, wrangling, visualisation, analysis

**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | Top |   
|:---|--|---|---|-|
| :pencil2: [Education in ES](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/python/educacao-es) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | A project close to 🏡 home. Analysis of educational data from my home state using data from the institute responsible for promoting studies, research and periodic evaluations on the Brazilian educational system - Which city has the most number os schools, How many students there are per school, How much does each city invest in its students? | _pandas, seaborn, matplotlib_ | [Top](#table-of-contents) |
| 📑 [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/python/nlp-learning) |  Data Wrangling, EDA & Machine Learning | Analysis using NLP techniques to interpret text data that I was working with in my PhD and to learn some techniques I was going to use in other context. The text used to perform this analysis was a transcript of a chemistry class for undergraduation students. | _pandas, scikit-learn, pickle, textblob, spacy, re, string, numpy, wordcloud, matplotlib_ | [Top](#table-of-contents) |

# SQL

**Level:** Intermediate SQL

**Functions:** joins, subqueries, inline views, subquery factoring (WITH clause), row limiting clause, aggregate functions (count(), avg(), sum(), min(), max()), analytic functions (partition, windowing, ranking, LISTAGG, LAG, LEAD, FIRST, LAST, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE), procedural functions, procedures.

| Project Name | Description | SQL 'Flavour' | Top |
|---|---|---|-|
| 📊 [SQL Made Practical](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/sql/oracle-sql-course) | Course I took that aims to teach SQL in a pratical way. Every topic is teached on video and after that, it gives a challenge that I had to do it by myself. Some of the queries are a little off topic because I was exploring learning possibilities within the lesson. | Oracle, SQL | [Top](#table-of-contents) |
| 🔖 SQL Learning | **Temporary Section.** For now this is just queries that I used to practice SQL | PL/SQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server | [Top](#table-of-contents) |
